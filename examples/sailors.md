People are good at making inductive leaps.

Number game.

{16, 8, 2, 64}

Does 7 belong?
Does 10?
Does 4?

{60, 80, 10, 30}

Why?

Get some inuitions.

Zoom in on 2, 8, 16, 64.

What are some possible hypotheses?

### Prior on Hypotheses

~~~
(define power-of-2)
(define multiples-of-2)
prior is uniform
~~~

### Generating Sequences

~~~
~~~

#### Likelihood

~~~
~~~

### Posterior

Both prior and likelihood.

### Sampling method

- be intentionally deceiptful.
- be helpful!

* positive examples
* positive and negative examples
* labelling things in the world

OED? If you have 2 competing hypotheses, what number should you test next?



### Hypotheses

~~~
(define rule (uniform-draw '()))

(define ...)
~~~

### Conditional Probabilities

### Generative Models

Brainstorm.

Let's formalize these intuitions.

### Backup examples?

* word/concept learning (rational rules)
*
