CPS:
- fix function declarations so that they can be recursive.
- need to trampoline continuation calls..?

Inference:
- some kind of top-level expectation or hist fns?
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?
- streams / generators that incrementally run a computation, applying global factors along the way.

Testing:
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- test suite for inference methods
- write cps tests for bigger programs

Browser integration:
-script tag compilation / execution
-code box execution?
