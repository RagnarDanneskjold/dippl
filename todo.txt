-primitive fn calling:
  - existing freeVars method wraps too much (non-functions) and misses object method calls.
  - existing withContinuation doesn’t work right when called on object methods.
  - currently must call ordinary primitives with callPrimitive… could try to detect some…

- extend cps: {..} object constructor, binary operators?
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- test forward sampling and enumeration [NDG]
- write cps tests for bigger programs, write inference tests

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..
