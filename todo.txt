-FIXME
  - get straight how to call coroutine.sample, etc. need to have continuation passed in and have ‘this’ bound to coroutine object…
  - primitive non-functions are wrapped, is a problem for erp objects (etc?)
  - method name collisions: “var factor = function(score){return coroutine.factor(score)}”?
  - methods of primitive objects aren’t wrapped?
  
  

- extend cps: {..} object constructor
- use callcc syntax
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- write cps tests for bigger programs

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..

- test forward sampling and enumeration [NDG]
