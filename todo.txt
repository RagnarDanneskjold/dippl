CPS:
- think about smarter CPS that generates fewer garbage redexes..

Inference:
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?
- high-level idioms for incremental factors. PCFG?

Browser integration:
- script tag compilation / execution
* run javascript code from appropriately tagged boxes (tag in md or in first line comment?).



Lectures:

- foundations?

- Enumeration:
  - first simple function implementation on sample, continues on first element of support.
  - but… want to explore multiple returns from same sample… need re-enterable “futures”.
  - introduce continuations, with examples.
  - show sketch of enumeration *if* sample gets K — i.e. coroutine.
  - CPS to make K available.

  - implementing enumeration for real…


  - using CPS, simple version w/o scores, with scores, priority queue
  - pragmatics example
  - caching (interpolation?)



- Particle filter…
