- automatically cps-wrap primitives [AST]
  - withContinuation to prevent this

- extend cps [AST]
  - ArrayExpression
  - MemberExpression (or will this make life difficult? maybe only for primitives?)

- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- write cps tests for bigger programs

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..

- test forward sampling [NDG]

- implement enumeration using continuations (in header.js)
