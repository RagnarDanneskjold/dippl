CPS:
- getting rid of the stupid f(_?){…}(undefined) from CPS.
- get external function call business straightened out?

Inference:
- implement the particle cascade just to see how it works.
- benchmark against webchurch, maybe do some profiling
- clean up and simplify codebase
- automating some of the factor splitting, moving, inserting stuff?

Integration:
- script tag compilation / execution
- smart pages examples
- church to webppl compiler (based on webchurch or sweet macros)

Ideas and examples:
- incremental speaker where word string is constructed with heuristic factor:
     factor( mean(map(completions(uttSoFar), function(c){return literalListener(c).score(world)})))
- cooler vision example
- idioms or constructs for managing heuristic factors (so that they will cancel eventually).
- learning the best heuristic factors.




Lectures:


- Particle filter
- Beam search??
- PMCMC…
- awesomer vision example

- MH??
