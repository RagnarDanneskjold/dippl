- extend cps [AST]
  - withContinuation

- automatically cps-wrap primitives [AST]
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- write cps tests for bigger programs
- add ArrayExpression
- rename sppl to wppl
- wrap top-level wppl code in thunk
- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..


- figure out correct query boundary: what do we do when the computation is done?

- implement forward sampling using continuations (in header.js) [NDG]

- implement enumeration using continuations (in header.js)
