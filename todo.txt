- automatically cps-wrap primitives
  - withContinuation to prevent this

- extend cps
  - ArrayExpression
  - MemberExpression
  - {..} object constructor

- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- write cps tests for bigger programs

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..

- test forward sampling and enumeration [NDG]
