CPS:
- think about smarter CPS that generates fewer garbage redexes..

Inference:
- useful display for ERPs to show results of inference. (ERP.display method?)
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?
- high-level idioms for incremental factors. PCFG?

Browser integration:
- script tag compilation / execution
- also run javascript code directly?



Lectures:

- go over outline, clean up lecture descriptions, move non-lectures to different list on index page.

- wppl examples for first day.

- foundations?

- CPS: 
  -continuation def and examples.
  -coroutine w/ k: first do sample with call/cc, then say computation is in CPS, so it gets handed a K for exit. do multisample and save enumeration for next section.
  -CPS ideas (andreas).

- Enumeration:
  - using CPS, simple version w/o scores, with scores, priority queue
  - pragmatics example
  - caching (interpolation?)

- Particle filterâ€¦
