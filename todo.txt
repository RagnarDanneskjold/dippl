CPS:
- getting rid of the stupid f(_?){…}(undefined) from CPS.

Inference:
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?

Browser integration:
- script tag compilation / execution
- smart pages examples


Lectures:

- sequentializing factors
  -cooler vision example?
  -in pragmatics:
   -incremental world construction with heuristic factor(meaning(utt,worldSoFar)?0:-10)
   [-does this favor indirect composition where meaning can be computed before world?]

   -extended integrated language
   -incremental speaker where word string is constructed with heuristic factor:
     factor( mean(map(completions(uttSoFar), function(c){return literalListener(c).score(world)})))



- Particle filter
- Beam search??
- PMCMC…
- awesomer vision example

- MH??

- pcfgs…
