CPS:
- binary and unary operator expression. (need to handle negative numbers!)
- detect CallExpression that has callee a MemberExpression, and wrap this in callPrimitive.
- need to trampoline continuation calls..?

Inference:
- some kind of top-level expectation or hist fns?
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?
- streams / generators that incrementally run a computation, applying global factors along the way.

Testing:
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- test suite for inference methods
- write cps tests for bigger programs
