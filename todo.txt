-primitive fn calling:
  - existing freeVars method wraps too much (non-functions) and misses object method calls.
  - existing withContinuation doesnâ€™t work right when called on object methods.

- extend cps: {..} object constructor
- use callcc syntax?
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- write cps tests for bigger programs

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..

- test forward sampling and enumeration [NDG]
