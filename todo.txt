CPS:
- think about smarter CPS that generates fewer garbage redexes..

Inference:
- maybe implement the particle cascade just to see how it works?
- high-level idioms for incremental factors. PCFG?

Browser integration:
- script tag compilation / execution
* run javascript code from appropriately tagged boxes (tag in md or in first line comment?).



Lectures:

- foundations?

- sequentializing factors
  -merge hmm and lec04 pages:
   -intro hmm
   -show breaking and moving factors in binomial
   -show breaking and moving in hmm
   -talk about heuristic canceling factor pairs
   -do binomial example with heuristic pairs
   -do vision example (in this page or point to other one), compare non-incremental

  -pcfg: basic and incrementalized (posterior predictive, since it’s easier)

  -in pragmatics:
   -incremental world construction with heuristic factor(meaning(utt,worldSoFar)?0:-10)
   [-does this favor indirect composition where meaning can be computed before world?]

   -extended integrated language
   -incremental speaker where word string is constructed with heuristic factor:
     factor( mean(map(completions(uttSoFar), function(c){return literalListener(c).score(world)})))



- Particle filter
- Beam search??
- PMCMC…
- awesomer vision example

- MH??

- pcfgs…

- shootout
