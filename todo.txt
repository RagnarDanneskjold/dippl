CPS:
- binary and unary operator expression? (need to handle negative numbers!)
- {…} object constructor
- currently must call ordinary primitives with callPrimitive… could try to detect some…
  - existing freeVars method wraps too much (non-functions) and misses object method calls.
  - existing withContinuation doesn’t work right when called on object methods.

- probably need to trampoline continuation calls..

Inference:
- particle filter
- some kind of top-level expectation or hist fns?

Testing:
- simplify tests (use eval to get expected results) [AST]
- test suite for inference methods
- write cps tests for bigger programs
